# Quick-Union
Implemented with an array id[] of size N
Interpretation: p and q are connect if, and only if, they have the same id

Time Complexities:
|  Algorithm  |   intialize   | union | find  |
|  ---------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| quick union |  	O(N) 	  |  O(N) | O(N)  |


Tree's can get very tall.
Find takes O(N) which is too long.
